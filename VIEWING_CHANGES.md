## 🔧 Developer Tools Check

### 1. Check Network Tab

- Refresh page
- Look for `Communities.tsx` or the compiled JS file
- Should show 200 status (success)

### 2. Check Elements Tab
- Inspect a community card
- Look for these classes:
  - `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500` (cover)
  - `w-24 h-24` (avatar size)
  - `ring-2 ring-blue-200` (avatar ring)

### 3. Check React Components
If you have React DevTools:
- Find the Communities component
- Check props and state
- Verify `sortBy` state exists (new feature)

## 🚀 Quick Test

To quickly verify changes are working:

1. **Hover over a card** → Should see:
   - Shadow increases
   - Border turns blue
   - Avatar ring grows

2. **Click Sort dropdown** → Should see:
   - "Most Members"
   - "Newest First"
   - "Alphabetical"

3. **Look at avatars** → Should be:
   - Much larger (96px instead of 48px)
   - Overlapping the gradient cover
   - With white border and blue ring

## 📱 Mobile View

If testing on mobile or responsive view:
- Cards should stack in 1 column
- All features still visible
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Same enhanced design

## ⚡ Performance Check

The page should:
- Load quickly
- Animations should be smooth (60fps)
- No lag when hovering
- Backdrop blur effects should work

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If changes still aren't visible:

1. **Check you're on the right page**
   - URL should end with `/communities`
   - Not `/community/:id` (detail page)

2. **Check if TypeScript compiled**
   - Look for any build errors in terminal
   - Vite should show "✓" symbols for successful builds

3. **Verify imports**
   - All new icons should be imported (Sparkles, Heart, Eye, etc.)
   - Check browser console for import errors

4. **Check Routes**
   - Ensure the route for `/communities` points to this file
   - Check `src/App.tsx` or routing configuration

## 📞 Getting Help

If issues persist, check:

1. **Terminal Output** - Any error messages?
2. **Browser Console** - Any JavaScript errors?
3. **Network Tab** - Are files loading correctly?
4. **File Timestamp** - Is the file recently modified?
