## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
→ Try: `create-storage-buckets-simple.sql`

### "Duplicate key" error
→ Good! Buckets exist. Just make them public:
```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true 
WHERE id IN ('profile-pictures', 'community-avatars', 'community-post-images');
```

### Upload still fails
→ Check buckets are marked "Public" in Storage section
