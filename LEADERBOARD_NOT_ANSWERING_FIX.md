# üîß Leaderboard Not Answering - Complete Fix

## üéØ **Root Cause**
The leaderboard isn't responding because there are no communities in your database, and users need to be members of a community to use the leaderboard features.

## üìã **Step-by-Step Solution**

### **Step 1: Create a Community**
You need at least one community for the leaderboard to work:

1. **In your app**, navigate to the communities section
2. **Create a new community** (or use an existing one)
3. **Make sure you join/are a member** of that community

### **Step 2: Initialize Leaderboard for the Community**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID' with your actual community ID
-- Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID' with your actual user ID

-- Initialize leaderboard settings for the community
INSERT INTO community_leaderboard_settings (community_id)
VALUES ('YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID')
ON CONFLICT (community_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Initialize your user score (this normally happens automatically)
INSERT INTO community_user_scores (
  community_id, 
  user_id, 
  performance_score, 
  rank,
  chat_score,
  video_call_score,
  participation_score
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID',
  'YOUR_USER_ID',
  100,  -- Starting score
  1,    -- Starting rank
  20,   -- Chat score
  30,   -- Video call score
  25    -- Participation score
) ON CONFLICT (community_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### **Step 3: Quick Test Setup (Alternative)**
If you want to test immediately, run this simplified initialization:

```sql
-- Get your community and user IDs first
SELECT 'Community ID:', id, name FROM communities LIMIT 1;
SELECT 'User ID:', user_id, username FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Then use those IDs in the initialization above
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative: Automatic Initialization**
