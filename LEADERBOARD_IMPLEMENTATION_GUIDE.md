  const { 
    trackPostCreated, 
    trackCommentPosted, 
    trackLikeGiven,
    trackVideoCallJoined,
    trackResourceShared
  } = useActivityTracker(communityId);

  // When a post is created
  trackPostCreated({
    content: postContent,
    has_image: !!imageUrl,
    category: 'discussion'
  });

  // When a comment is posted
  trackCommentPosted(commentContent, postId);

  // When a like is given
  trackLikeGiven('post', postId);

  // When user joins a video call
  trackVideoCallJoined({
    call_id: callId,
    duration_minutes: 45,
    speaking_time_minutes: 12,
    camera_enabled: true
  });
}
```

#### Access Leaderboard Data

```typescript
import { useLeaderboard, useUserProgress } from '@/hooks/useLeaderboard';

function LeaderboardComponent({ communityId }) {
  const { leaderboard, userPosition, isLoading, refreshLeaderboard } = useLeaderboard(communityId);
  const { progress, feedback } = useUserProgress(communityId);

  // Display leaderboard data
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Rank: #{userPosition?.rank}</h2>
      <p>Score: {userPosition?.performance_score}</p>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üìà Scoring System

### Base Activity Scores

## üöÄ Next Steps & Extensibility

The system is designed to be extensible. Consider adding:

### Already Prepared (Need Implementation)
- Badge system (interface exists)
- Achievement system (interface exists)
- Goal setting (interface exists)

### Future Enhancements
- Voice analysis during video calls
- Cross-community rankings
- Mentorship matching based on scores
- Shareable achievement certificates
- Webhook integrations
- Custom scoring algorithms
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Leaderboard Shows No Data

1. **Check Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Ensure migration is applied
   # Run: supabase migration up
   ```

2. **Initialize User Scores**
   - User scores are created automatically when activities are tracked
   - If missing, they'll be initialized on first query

3. **Track Activities**
   - Make sure activity tracking is called when users interact
   - Check console for tracking errors

### AI Features Not Working

- AI features use mock implementation by default
- To use real AI, add OpenAI API key to environment:
  ```env
  VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

### Performance Issues

- Leaderboard refreshes every 10 minutes by default
- Adjust `refetchInterval` in `useLeaderboard` hook
- Consider caching strategies for large communities
- Use database indexes (already created in migration)
