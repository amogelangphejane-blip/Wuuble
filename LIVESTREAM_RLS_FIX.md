# Live Streams Row Level Security Fix

## Problem Description

The error "New row violates row level security policy for table 'live streams'" occurs because of a mismatch between the RLS policies and the actual database schema.

### Root Cause

The enhanced live streams migration (`20250127000000_enhance_live_streams.sql`) introduced RLS policies that check for `cm.status = 'approved'` in the `community_members` table, but the original `community_members` table schema doesn't have a `status` field.

**Problematic RLS policies:**
- Lines 258, 268, 286, 302, 313, 326, 341 in `20250127000000_enhance_live_streams.sql`
- All check for `cm.status = 'approved'` but `community_members` table only has: `id`, `community_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `joined_at`

### Files Affected

1. **Migration file:** `supabase/migrations/20250127000000_enhance_live_streams.sql`
2. **Service file:** `src/services/livestreamService.ts` (createLivestream method)
3. **Database table:** `community_members` (missing `status` column)

## Solution

### Option 1: Add Status Field to community_members (Recommended)

I've created a new migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250130000000_fix_community_members_status.sql`

**To apply this fix:**

1. **If using Supabase CLI with local development:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset --local
   ```

2. **If applying directly to remote database:**
   Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add status column to community_members table
ALTER TABLE public.community_members 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'approved' 
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'banned'));

-- Update existing members to have 'approved' status
UPDATE public.community_members 
SET status = 'approved' 
WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_members_status ON public.community_members(status);

-- Update RLS policies to be more permissive during the transition
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view community members they have access to" ON public.community_members;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view community members they have access to" 
  ON public.community_members 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.communities 
      WHERE id = community_id 
      AND (NOT is_private OR creator_id = auth.uid() OR 
           EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.community_members cm WHERE cm.community_id = id AND cm.user_id = auth.uid()))
    )
  );

-- Allow users to join communities with approved status by default
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join communities" ON public.community_members;
CREATE POLICY "Users can join communities" 
  ON public.community_members 
  FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id AND status = 'approved');

-- Add policy for community admins to manage member status
CREATE POLICY "Community admins can manage member status" 
  ON public.community_members 
  FOR UPDATE 
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.community_members 
      WHERE community_id = community_members.community_id 
      AND user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND role IN ('admin', 'moderator')
    ) OR 
    auth.uid() = user_id  -- Users can update their own membership
  );
```

### Option 2: Update RLS Policies to Use Existing Fields (Alternative)

If you prefer not to add a status field, update the RLS policies in the enhanced live streams migration to remove the status check:

Replace all instances of:
```sql
WHERE cm.user_id = auth.uid() AND cm.status = 'approved'
```

With:
```sql
WHERE cm.user_id = auth.uid()
```

## Verification

After applying the fix, test by:

1. **Creating a live stream:**
   ```typescript
   const stream = await livestreamService.createLivestream({
     title: "Test Stream",
     description: "Testing RLS fix",
     community_id: "your-community-id"
   });
   ```

2. **Check the database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM community_members LIMIT 5;
   -- Should now show the status column with 'approved' values
   ```

3. **Verify RLS policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, roles 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename = 'live_streams';
   ```

## Migration Order

The migrations should be applied in this order:
1. `20250126000000_add_live_streams.sql` (original)
2. `20250130000000_fix_community_members_status.sql` (new fix)
3. `20250127000000_enhance_live_streams.sql` (enhanced features)

## Additional Notes

- The `status` field allows for future features like member approval workflows
- Default status is 'approved' to maintain backward compatibility
- Community admins can manage member status through the new RLS policy
- The fix maintains all existing functionality while resolving the RLS violation

## Testing

After applying the fix, the live stream creation should work without RLS violations. The `livestreamService.createLivestream()` method will be able to insert records into the `live_streams` table successfully.
