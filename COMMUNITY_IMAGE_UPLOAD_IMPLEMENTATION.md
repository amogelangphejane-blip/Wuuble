### Admin Flow (Platform Settings)

1. Admin navigates to Admin Platform Settings
2. "Storage Bucket Setup" card appears at top
3. Admin clicks "Check Status"
4. System displays status of all three buckets
5. Admin clicks "Setup Buckets" if needed
6. System creates missing buckets
7. Detailed results are displayed
8. Status updates to show all buckets as configured

### Automated Script Flow

1. Developer runs `node create-storage-buckets.js`
2. Script loads environment variables
