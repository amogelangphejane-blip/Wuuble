# Quick Start: Fix Discussion Image Posts

## 🎯 The Problem
Images in discussions show as "[Image Post]" text instead of displaying the actual image.

## ✅ The Solution (Already Applied)
Code changes have been made to:
- Upload images to Supabase Storage
- Save image URLs to database
- Display images correctly

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### One Simple Step!

**Run this SQL in your Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of **`fix-image-posts.sql`**
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

That's it! 🎉

## 📋 What the SQL Script Does

✅ Creates the `image_url` column (if missing)  
✅ Creates the storage bucket for images  
✅ Sets up security policies  
✅ Adds performance indexes  
✅ Cleans up old placeholder texts  

## 🧪 Test It

After running the SQL:

1. Go to any community discussion page
2. Click **"New Post"**
3. Click **"Photo"** button
4. Select an image
5. Click **"Post"**
6. ✅ Your image should display!

### If images still don't work:

   - Look for ✅ checkmarks in the results

## 🔐 Storage Configuration

The script creates a storage bucket with:
