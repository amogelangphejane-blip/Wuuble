## The Solution (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run SQL Script
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste this entire script:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'community-avatars',
  'community-avatars',
  true,
  5242880,
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Community avatars are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload community avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Community creators can update their community avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Community creators can delete their community avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Community avatars are publicly viewable"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'community-avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload community avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'community-avatars' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'communities'
);

CREATE POLICY "Community creators can update their community avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'community-avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.communities 
    WHERE id = (storage.foldername(name))[2]::uuid 
    AND creator_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Community creators can delete their community avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'community-avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.communities 
    WHERE id = (storage.foldername(name))[2]::uuid 
    AND creator_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

4. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify
1. Refresh your application
2. Go to Community Settings ‚Üí General tab
3. The "Choose Image" button should now be **enabled** and **working**

2. Enter your Supabase URL and Anon Key
3. Click **"Run Diagnostic"** to see the problem
4. Click **"Auto Fix"** to attempt repair
5. Click **"Test Upload"** to verify
