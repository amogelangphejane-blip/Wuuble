This guide will help you set up the digital marketplace feature in your community-based app, allowing creators to sell their digital products directly through the platform.

## üéØ Overview

The Digital Store feature includes:

- **Product Management**: Sellers can create, edit, and manage digital products
- **Marketplace**: Browse and search products with advanced filtering
- **Secure Checkout**: Complete payment processing with order management

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Supabase project set up
- Environment variables configured

### 2. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already included in your `package.json`. If you need to install them separately:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 4. Run Setup Script

Execute the setup script to create all necessary database tables and storage buckets:

```bash
node setup-digital-store.js
```

This will:
- Create all required database tables
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create storage buckets for product files and images
- Insert default product categories
- Verify the installation

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üìä Database Schema

The setup creates the following tables:

### Core Tables

- **`product_categories`**: Product categorization (E-books, Templates, etc.)
- **`digital_products`**: Main product information and metadata
- **`seller_profiles`**: Extended seller information and store settings
- **`product_orders`**: Purchase orders and transaction records

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS policies that ensure:
- Users can only manage their own products and orders
- Buyers can only access their purchased products
- Sellers can only view their own sales data
- Public data (product listings) is appropriately accessible

### File Access Control

- Product files are stored in private buckets
- Only buyers who completed purchases can download files
- Images are stored in public buckets for performance
- Download tracking prevents unauthorized access

## üé® UI Components

### Main Components

- **`DigitalMarketplace`**: Product browsing and search interface
- **`SellerDashboard`**: Seller management and analytics
- **`ProductCheckout`**: Purchase flow and payment processing
- **`BuyerLibrary`**: Purchase history and downloads
- **`StoreNotifications`**: Activity notifications

### Integration Points

- Community detail pages include a "Store" tab
- User profile menu includes store-related links
- Header navigation includes marketplace access

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Setup Script Fails
- Verify environment variables are correct
- Check Supabase project permissions
- Ensure service role key has sufficient privileges

#### File Upload Errors
- Check storage bucket permissions
- Verify file size limits
- Confirm file type restrictions

#### RLS Policy Issues
- Review user authentication status
- Check policy definitions in migration file
- Verify user roles and permissions

### Database Issues

If tables aren't created properly:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%product%';

-- Check RLS status
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename LIKE '%product%';
```

### Storage Issues

If file uploads fail:

```javascript
// Check bucket existence
const { data: buckets } = await supabase.storage.listBuckets();
console.log('Available buckets:', buckets);

// Test upload permissions
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('digital-products')
  .upload('test.txt', new Blob(['test']));
```

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Adding New Features

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend:

1. **New Product Types**: Add categories and validation rules
2. **Payment Methods**: Integrate additional payment providers  
3. **Analytics**: Extend seller dashboard with more metrics
4. **Social Features**: Add product sharing and recommendations

### Database Migrations

For schema changes, create new migration files following the naming convention:
```
YYYYMMDD000000_description.sql
```

### Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:
- Product upload success rates
- Payment completion rates
- File download performance
- User engagement with store features

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format and appropriate sizing
2. **Caching**: Implement CDN for product images
3. **Pagination**: Products are paginated by default (20 per page)
4. **Indexing**: Database indexes are created for common queries
5. **File Compression**: Compress large product files when possible

### Scaling Considerations

- Consider moving file storage to dedicated CDN
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Use read replicas for analytics queries
- Monitor and optimize database query performance

## ü§ù Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the database schema and RLS policies
3. Test with the setup script in a clean environment
4. Check Supabase logs for detailed error messages
