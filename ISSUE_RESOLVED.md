# Issue Resolved: Communities Page Enhancement Now Visible

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The enhanced Communities page wasn't visible because the route in `App.tsx` was pointing to the wrong component.

### What Was Wrong:
```tsx
// App.tsx was using:
<Route path="/communities" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <SimpleCommunities />  // ❌ Old component
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### What Was Fixed:
```tsx
// Now correctly points to:
<Route path="/communities" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <Communities />  // ✅ Enhanced component
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```
