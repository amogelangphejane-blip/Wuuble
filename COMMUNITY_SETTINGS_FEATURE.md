# Community Settings Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the community settings feature that allows community owners/creators to customize their groups, including changing the group profile picture and deleting the group.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Community Settings Dialog Component
The `CommunitySettings` component (`src/components/CommunitySettings.tsx`) provides a comprehensive settings interface with:

#### **General Settings Tab**
- **Community Name**: Edit community name with validation (3-50 characters)
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Integrated with `CommunityAvatarUpload` component
  - Upload custom avatar images
  - Preview before saving
  - Stored in Supabase storage

#### **Privacy & Visibility Tab**
- Private/Public community toggle
- Join approval requirements
- Member invite permissions
- Search discoverability settings
- Content & feature controls:
  - Allow posts
  - Require post approval
  - Allow events
  - Allow group calls

#### **Members Management Tab**
- View all community members
- Display member roles (Creator, Admin, Moderator, Member)
- Change member roles (Owner only)
- Remove members from community
- View join dates and member count

#### **Notifications Tab**
- Configure notification frequency:
  - Immediate
  - Hourly Digest
  - Daily Digest
  - Weekly Digest
  - None
- Direct messaging controls

#### **Danger Zone Tab**
- **Delete Community**: Permanent deletion with safety measures
  - Confirmation dialog requiring exact community name input
  - Warning about all data that will be deleted:
    - Community settings
    - All posts and discussions
    - All events
    - Member data
    - Uploaded images and files

### 2. Integration in Community Pages

#### **SkoolStyleCommunityDetail.tsx** (Primary Community Page)
Updated to include:
- Settings gear icon in top header (visible only to owner)
- "Community Settings" button in left sidebar navigation (owner only)
- Full `CommunitySettings` dialog integration
- Proper owner detection using `creator_id` field
- Handlers for community update and deletion

#### **CommunityDetail.tsx** (Alternative Community Page)
Updated to include:
- Settings button in community header (owner only)
- Full `CommunitySettings` dialog integration
- Consistent owner detection logic
- Same update and delete handlers

### 3. Owner Detection & Permissions

The system now properly:
- Detects if the current user is the community owner
- Handles both `creator_id` (database) and `owner_id` (frontend) fields
- Only shows settings to the community owner/creator
- Restricts access to sensitive operations

### 4. Database Integration

Settings are saved to the `communities` table with fields:
- `name` - Community name
- `avatar_url` - Profile picture URL
- `is_private` - Privacy setting
- `updated_at` - Auto-updated timestamp
- `creator_id` - Owner/creator reference

### 5. User Experience Features

#### **Settings Access Points**
1. **Top Header Icon**: Quick access gear icon (SkoolStyle layout)
2. **Sidebar Button**: Prominent "Community Settings" button
3. **Community Info Button**: Traditional settings button (Classic layout)

#### **Update Flow**
1. Owner clicks settings icon/button
2. Dialog opens with current settings loaded
3. Owner makes changes in various tabs
4. Validation occurs on save
5. Success toast notification
6. Community data refreshes automatically

#### **Delete Flow**
1. Owner navigates to "Danger Zone" tab
2. Clicks "Delete Community" button
3. Confirmation dialog appears with warnings
4. Owner must type exact community name
5. Deletion executes after confirmation
6. User redirected to communities list
7. Success toast notification

## üé® UI/UX Features

- Dark mode support throughout

### Safety Features

- High contrast visual elements

## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showSettings, setShowSettings] = useState(false);
const [isOwner, setIsOwner] = useState(false);
```

### Owner Detection
```typescript
// Handle both creator_id and owner_id fields
const ownerId = data.owner_id || data.creator_id;
setIsOwner(ownerId === user.id);
```

### Settings Dialog Props
```typescript
<CommunitySettings
  community={{
    id: community.id,
    name: community.name,
    avatar_url: community.avatar_url,
    is_private: community.is_private,
    member_count: community.member_count,
    creator_id: community.owner_id,
    created_at: community.created_at
  }}
  isOpen={showSettings}
  onClose={() => setShowSettings(false)}
  onUpdate={() => {
    fetchCommunity();
    toast({ title: "Success", description: "Community updated" });
  }}
  onDelete={() => {
    toast({ title: "Community Deleted" });
    navigate('/communities');
  }}
  isCreator={isOwner}
  userId={user?.id || ''}
/>
```

### Update Handler
```typescript
const handleSave = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('communities')
    .update({
      name: settings.name,
      avatar_url: settings.avatar_url,
      is_private: settings.is_private,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    .eq('id', community.id);
    
  if (!error) {
    onUpdate();
    onClose();
  }
};
```

### Delete Handler
```typescript
const handleDeleteCommunity = async () => {
  if (deleteConfirmText !== community.name) return;
  
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('communities')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', community.id);
    
  if (!error) {
    onDelete?.();
    onClose();
  }
};
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Communities Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.communities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  creator_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  member_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- **SELECT**: Users can view public communities or communities they're members of
- **UPDATE**: Only the creator can update their community
- **DELETE**: Only the creator can delete their community

## üì± User Interface Locations

### For Community Owners:

1. **SkoolStyle Layout** (`/community/:id`)
   - Settings gear icon in top-right header
   - "Community Settings" button in left sidebar

   - Settings button next to community name

### Settings Dialog Sections:
