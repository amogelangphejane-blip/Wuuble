## 🚀 3 Steps to Fix (Takes 30 seconds)

### 1️⃣ Tap the Back Arrow
Look at the **top-left** of your screen.

You should see something like:
```
← Back to Tech Community
```

### 2️⃣ Tap "Join Community"
Now you're on the main community page.

Look for a button that says **"Join Community"**

**Where it might be:**
- Top-right corner
- Below the community name
- In a menu (tap ⋮ or ≡ if you don't see it)

**👆 TAP IT**

You should see a success message.

### 3️⃣ Go Back to Classroom
Look for:
- **"Classroom"** link/button
- **"Resources"** in the menu
- Or tap the **menu icon** (≡) and find Classroom

**👆 TAP TO GO TO CLASSROOM**

Now try **"Add Resource"** again - **it will work!** ✅
