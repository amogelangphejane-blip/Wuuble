## 💰 Revenue Split System

### How It Works

When a patron pays $10/month:
- **$7.00 (70%)** → Goes to the creator's wallet
- **$3.00 (30%)** → Platform fee

### Payment Flow

```
Patron Payment ($10)
    ↓
[Stripe Processing]
    ↓
Revenue Split:
├─ Creator: $7.00 (70%) → Held for 7 days → Available Balance
└─ Platform: $3.00 (30%) → Platform Revenue
    ↓
After 7 days:
└─ Creator can request payout
```

### Security Measures

1. **7-Day Hold Period**: Funds held for 7 days before becoming available for withdrawal
2. **Transaction Tracking**: Every payment logged with full details
3. **Refund Protection**: Chargeback and refund handling built-in
4. **Secure Payouts**: Bank transfer, PayPal, or Stripe transfers

---

// 2. Database function splits revenue:
const split = {
  gross: 25.00,
  platform: 7.50,  // 30%
  creator: 17.50   // 70%
}

// 3. Create revenue transaction
revenue_transactions: {
  gross_amount: 25.00,
  platform_fee: 7.50,
  creator_amount: 17.50,
  status: 'completed',
  card_brand: 'visa',
  card_last4: '4242'
}

// 4. Update creator wallet
creator_wallets: {
  pending_balance: +17.50,
  lifetime_earnings: +17.50
}

// 5. Record platform revenue
platform_revenue: {
  amount: 7.50,
  fee_percentage: 30.00
}
```

5. **Member sees success message**
6. **Creator sees $17.50 in pending balance**

### After 7 Days

```javascript
// Cron job runs: release_pending_balances()
creator_wallets: {
  balance: +17.50,        // Now available!
  pending_balance: -17.50 // Moved to available
}
```

1. **Creator clicks "Withdraw Funds"**
2. **Enters amount** ($50 minimum typically $10 here)
3. **Selects method** (Bank/PayPal/Stripe)
4. **Submits request**

```javascript
// Backend process
payout_requests: {
  amount: 50.00,
  method: 'bank_transfer',
  status: 'pending'
}

creator_wallets: {
  balance: -50.00  // Reserved
}
```

5. **Platform processes payout** (3-5 days for bank)
