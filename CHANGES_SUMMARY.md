```

### Upload Flow
```
1. Click "Choose Image" → File picker opens
2. Select image → Preview shows + filename displays
3. Click "Upload" → File uploads to Supabase
4. Success → Avatar updates + notification
```

### Storage Setup
```
- No automatic setup in community settings
- Users must run SQL script in Supabase Dashboard
- See: create-storage-buckets.sql
```

## What Still Works

✅ Choose Image button (with image icon)
✅ File picker opens when clicked
✅ Image preview after selection
✅ File name display
✅ Upload to Supabase storage
✅ Remove avatar option
✅ Loading states
✅ Error notifications
✅ Success notifications

## What Was Removed

❌ Automatic bucket detection
❌ Automatic bucket creation
❌ Warning banners about missing buckets
❌ Setup storage button in UI
❌ Loading indicators for setup process

## Storage Bucket Setup

**To create storage buckets, users must:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL script: `create-storage-buckets.sql`
3. Verify 3 buckets are created
4. Return to app and upload will work

**Alternative:**
- Use Admin Platform Settings → Storage Bucket Setup card
- (This still has the setup UI for admins)

## Clean Component

The component is now simpler and cleaner:
- No automatic setup logic
- No warning banners
- Straightforward upload functionality
- Better performance (no auto-checks)

## Testing

To test the "Choose Image" functionality:

1. Ensure storage buckets exist (run SQL script if needed)
2. Go to Community Settings → General tab
3. Click "Choose Image" button
4. Select an image file
5. Verify preview shows and filename displays
6. Click "Upload"
7. Verify upload succeeds and avatar updates

## Files to Delete (Optional Cleanup)

If you want to remove all auto-setup functionality:
- Keep: `/src/components/StorageSetup.tsx` (used in Admin panel)
- Keep: `/src/utils/setupStorage.ts` (has check functions)
- Keep: All SQL scripts (for manual setup)

## Summary

✅ **"Choose Image" icon works perfectly**
✅ **Clean, simple component**
✅ **No automatic setup interference**
✅ **All upload functionality intact**
✅ **Storage setup via SQL script only**

The component now focuses solely on the upload functionality without trying to automatically fix missing buckets.
