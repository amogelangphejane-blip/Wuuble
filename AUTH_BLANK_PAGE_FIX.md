# Authentication Blank Page Fix

## Issue
The app was showing a blank page after successful authentication with the message "Authenticated" but no content.

## Root Cause
The `useAuth` hook was being used in the `ProtectedRoute` component within `App.tsx`, but the App component itself was not wrapped with the `AuthProvider`. This caused the authentication context to be undefined, resulting in an error that rendered a blank page.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Import Statement
Added `AuthProvider` to the import from the useAuth hook:
```typescript
import { useAuth, AuthProvider } from '@/hooks/useAuth';
```

### 2. Wrapped App with AuthProvider
Changed the App component structure from:
```typescript
function App() {
  return (
    <LoadingProvider>
      <Router>
        ...
      </Router>
    </LoadingProvider>
  );
}
```

To:
```typescript
function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <LoadingProvider>
        <Router>
          ...
        </Router>
      </LoadingProvider>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

## How It Works

1. **AuthProvider** creates and manages the authentication context
2. It tracks the user session, authentication state, and provides auth methods
3. **useAuth hook** can now access this context from any component within the provider
4. **ProtectedRoute** component uses the auth context to check if user is authenticated
5. After successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page (/) which displays the Index component

## Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the app
3. Click "Sign In" or access any protected route
4. Enter credentials and authenticate
5. Verify you're redirected to the home page with the Random Video Chat interface

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/src/App.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper and import

## Result
The authentication flow now works correctly, and users can see the application content after logging in instead of a blank page.
