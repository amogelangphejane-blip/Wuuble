# 🎯 Marketplace Upload Issue - Root Cause Found!

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

Your marketplace uploads are failing due to **MIME type restrictions** in the `product-images` bucket that don't match what your application is trying to upload.

## 📊 **Test Results**

```
❌ image/jpeg: File type 'image/jpeg' not allowed in bucket 'product-images'
❌ image/png: File type 'image/png' not allowed in bucket 'product-images'  
❌ image/webp: File type 'image/webp' not allowed in bucket 'product-images'
```

## 🛠️ **The Problem**

Your Supabase bucket has MIME type restrictions that are **more restrictive** than what your code expects. 

**Your code expects:** `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
**Your bucket allows:** Different MIME types (possibly none, or different format)

## 🚀 **Solution**

### Option 1: Update Bucket MIME Types (Recommended)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Storage → `product-images` bucket
2. **Edit bucket settings**
3. **Set allowed MIME types to:**
   ```
   image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif
   ```
4. **Save changes**

### Option 2: Remove MIME Type Restrictions

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Storage → `product-images` bucket  
2. **Edit bucket settings**
3. **Clear the "Allowed MIME types" field** (leave empty)
4. **Save changes**

This allows all file types but relies on your application code to validate file types.

### Option 3: Update Application Code

If you want to keep your current bucket settings, update the code in `src/services/storeService.ts`:

```typescript
// Find lines 238 and 249 and update allowedTypes to match your bucket:
allowedTypes: [], // Remove restrictions, or match your bucket's exact MIME types
```

## ✅ **After Fix**

Once MIME types are aligned:

1. **Test the upload:**
   - Go to `/seller-dashboard`
   - Click "Add Product"
   - Upload an image file
   - Should work perfectly! 🎉

2. **Verify with test script:**
   ```bash
   node test-marketplace-upload-flow.cjs
   ```

## 🔐 **Authentication Note**

The tests also show authentication requirements are working correctly:
- ✅ Users must be signed in to upload (security working)
- ✅ RLS policies are enforcing proper access control

## 🎯 **Summary**

**Root Cause:** MIME type mismatch between bucket configuration and application code
**Fix:** Align bucket MIME types with application expectations
**Result:** Uploads will work perfectly once MIME types match

This is a common configuration issue that's easy to fix! 🛠️✨
