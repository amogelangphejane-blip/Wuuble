### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: Database tables haven't been created yet
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Run the setup script
node setup-digital-store.cjs
```

#### 2. "Connection Error" Message
**Problem**: Supabase client not properly configured
**Solution**:
- Check if `@supabase/supabase-js` is installed: `npm ls @supabase/supabase-js`

  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
