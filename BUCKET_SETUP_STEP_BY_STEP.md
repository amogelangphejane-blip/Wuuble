## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Permission denied for table buckets"

**What to do:**
1. Make sure you're in Supabase SQL Editor (not an external tool)
2. Try the minimal version: `create-storage-buckets-minimal.sql`
3. Or create manually (see below)

### Problem: "Duplicate key value"

**What this means:**
✅ Good news! Buckets already exist

**What to do:**
1. Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click on each bucket
3. Make sure "Public bucket" toggle is ON
4. If not, turn it on and save

### Problem: Script runs but upload still fails

**What to do:**
1. Make sure buckets are set to PUBLIC
2. Run this quick fix:
   ```sql
   UPDATE storage.buckets 
   SET public = true 
   WHERE id IN ('profile-pictures', 'community-avatars', 'community-post-images');
   ```
3. Refresh your app

## 🛠️ Manual Creation (Last Resort)

If SQL scripts don't work, create manually:

### Create Bucket 1:
```
1. Go to Storage → New bucket
2. Name: profile-pictures
3. Public: ON (toggle)
4. File size limit: 5242880
5. Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
6. Click "Create bucket"
```

### Create Bucket 2:
```
1. Storage → New bucket
2. Name: community-avatars
3. Public: ON (toggle)
4. File size limit: 5242880
5. Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
6. Click "Create bucket"
```

### Create Bucket 3:
```
1. Storage → New bucket
2. Name: community-post-images
3. Public: ON (toggle)
4. File size limit: 10485760
5. Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
6. Click "Create bucket"
```

## 🎓 Understanding What Happened

**Why JavaScript method failed:**
- API key permissions too restrictive
- Network/firewall issues
- Supabase project restrictions

**Why SQL method works:**
- Direct database access
- Bypasses API limitations
- Uses Supabase's own SQL editor with elevated permissions

**What the scripts do:**
- Create 3 storage buckets
- Set them to public
- Configure size limits
- Add access policies

---

## 🔄 After Setup

Once buckets are created:

**Immediate:**
1. Refresh your app
2. Test image upload
3. Verify it works

**Optional:**
1. Check storage usage in Dashboard
2. Monitor upload errors in logs
3. Set up automatic cleanup (if needed)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Tip 1:** Always use Supabase SQL Editor
- Has proper permissions
- Built-in verification
- Easy to use

**Tip 2:** Make buckets public
- Required for images to display
- Set in bucket settings
- Very important!

**Tip 3:** Test after creation
- Don't assume it works
- Upload a test image
- Verify it displays

## 📞 Still Stuck?

If you've tried everything:

1. **Screenshot the error** from SQL Editor
2. **Check bucket settings** in Storage section
3. **Look at browser console** for errors
4. **Check Supabase logs** in Dashboard
5. **Verify authentication** works in your app

Common fixes:
- Clear browser cache
- Sign out and sign back in
- Try in incognito/private window
- Check internet connection

## 🎉 Success!

Once you see:
- ✅ 3 buckets in Storage
- ✅ All marked as Public
