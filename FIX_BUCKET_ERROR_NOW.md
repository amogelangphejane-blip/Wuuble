## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Quick Checks:
```sql
-- Run this to verify buckets exist:
SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id IN ('profile-pictures', 'community-avatars', 'community-post-images');

-- If they exist but not public, run this:
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true 
WHERE id IN ('profile-pictures', 'community-avatars', 'community-post-images');
```

### Or Create Manually:
1. Supabase Dashboard → Storage → New bucket
2. Create 3 buckets with these exact names:
   - `profile-pictures` (5MB, public)
   - `community-avatars` (5MB, public)
   - `community-post-images` (10MB, public)

## 💡 Why SQL Instead of JavaScript?

The JavaScript/API method failed because:
- API key has limited permissions
- Network/firewall restrictions
- Supabase project configuration

SQL method works because:
- Direct database access via Supabase's SQL Editor
- Elevated permissions
- Bypasses API limitations

1. Read: **BUCKET_SETUP_STEP_BY_STEP.md**
2. Check: Supabase Dashboard → Logs

4. Test: Try uploading in incognito window

**Bottom Line:** Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor, and your buckets will be created. It's that simple! 🎉
