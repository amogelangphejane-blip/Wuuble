## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Use simpler script
```bash
Try: create-storage-buckets-simple.sql
Then: create-storage-buckets-minimal.sql
Last: Manual creation via UI
```

### Issue 2: "Duplicate key value"

**Solution:** Buckets already exist!
```sql
-- Just make them public:
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true 
WHERE id IN ('profile-pictures', 'community-avatars', 'community-post-images');
```

### Issue 3: Script runs but upload fails

**Solution:** Check if buckets are public
```bash
1. Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click each bucket
3. Toggle "Public bucket" to ON
4. Save
```

### Issue 4: "relation 'storage.buckets' does not exist"

**Solution:** Enable storage first
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "storage-api";
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Scripts

### What's Different?

**Full Script:**
- Creates everything including security policies
- Most complete setup
- Might fail due to permissions

- Just buckets and basic config
- Higher success rate
- May need manual policy setup

**Minimal Script:**
- Bare minimum
- Highest success rate
- Need to configure everything else manually

### Which Should You Use?

**Use Full** if:
- You have full database access
- Want complete automated setup
- Don't want manual configuration

**Use Simple** if:
- Full script gave permission errors
- Want faster setup
- Don't mind manual policy setup

**Use Minimal** if:
- All else failed
- Very restrictive environment
- Just need buckets created ASAP
