## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Setting Up the Enhanced Members Feature

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Execute the SQL migration file
   psql -d your_database -f enhance-members-feature.sql
   ```

2. **Update TypeScript Types**
   - Import new types from `@/types/members`
   - Update existing member interfaces

3. **Import Components**
   ```typescript
   import EnhancedMemberCard from '@/components/EnhancedMemberCard';
   import MemberFilters from '@/components/MemberFilters';
   import MemberInvitation from '@/components/MemberInvitation';
   import { MemberService } from '@/services/memberService';
   ```

4. **Initialize Member Service**
   ```typescript
   // Fetch enhanced members
   const members = await MemberService.getEnhancedMembers(communityId, filters);
   
   // Get member statistics
   const stats = await MemberService.getMemberStats(communityId);
   
   // Track member activity
   await MemberService.trackActivity(communityId, userId, 'post', { postId });
   ```

### Managing Members

#### Inviting Members
```typescript
// Email invitation
const invitation = await MemberService.inviteMember(communityId, {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  role: 'member',
  message: 'Welcome to our community!'
});

// Generate invite link
const linkInvitation = await MemberService.inviteMember(communityId, {
  email: '', // Empty for link-based invites
  role: 'member'
});
```

#### Managing Roles
```typescript
// Promote member to moderator
await MemberService.updateMemberRole(memberId, 'moderator');

// Demote moderator to member
await MemberService.updateMemberRole(memberId, 'member');
```

#### Awarding Badges
```typescript
// Award badge to member
await MemberService.awardBadge(memberId, badgeId);
```

## üîÑ Activity Tracking

### Automatic Tracking
The system automatically tracks activities through database triggers:
- Post creation updates `last_active_at`
- Comment creation logs activity
- Event participation tracked
- Call participation recorded

### Manual Tracking
For custom activities, use the service:
```typescript
// Track custom activity
await MemberService.trackActivity(
  communityId,
  userId,
  'custom_action',
  { details: 'Additional data' }
);
```

### Online Status Management
```typescript
// Update online status
await MemberService.updateOnlineStatus(userId, true);

// Automatically set offline after inactivity
setTimeout(() => {
  MemberService.updateOnlineStatus(userId, false);
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes
```

## üé® Customization Options

### Styling
All components use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components:
- Consistent design system
- Dark mode support
