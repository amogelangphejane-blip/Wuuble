---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Adjust Point Values

Edit `src/types/gamification.ts`:

```typescript
export const ACTIVITY_POINTS = {
  post_created: 20,  // Change from 10
  comment_posted: 10, // Change from 5
  // ... etc
};
```

### Add New Achievements

Edit the migration file and add to `ACHIEVEMENT_DEFINITIONS`:

```typescript
{
  key: 'super_star',
  name: 'Super Star',
  description: 'Earned 5000 points',
  icon: '🌟',
  requirement: { type: 'points', value: 5000 }
}
```

Then add logic in `check_achievements()` function.

### Change Level Formula

Edit the `calculate_level` function in migration:

```sql
-- Level up every 200 points instead of 100
RETURN GREATEST(1, FLOOR(points / 200.0) + 1);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Leaderboard Empty

1. Check if migration is applied
2. Ensure users are members of communities
3. Try creating a post to trigger point tracking

### Points Not Updating

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Ensure RLS policies are correct
4. Check if `update_user_points` function exists

### Achievements Not Unlocking

1. Verify trigger is enabled
2. Check achievement requirements in code
3. Look at `user_achievements` table directly
4. Ensure `check_achievements()` function exists
