- **After**: Comprehensive debug logging system
- **Impact**: Easier troubleshooting and development

### 5. Database Access Verification ✅
- **Before**: Uncertain if database was properly configured
- **After**: All tables verified and accessible
- **Impact**: Confirmed core functionality works

## 🧪 Test Results

```
Database Tables: ✅ 6/6 accessible
Stream Retrieval: ✅ Working  
Realtime: ✅ Connected
WebRTC: ✅ Browser testing required (expected)
Overall Status: ✅ HEALTHY
```
