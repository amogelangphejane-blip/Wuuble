# Discussion Feature Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Posts were disappearing after being created in the discussion feature because the components were using mock data instead of real database operations.

## Root Cause
The `ModernDiscussion.tsx` component was:
1. Using hardcoded mock data for posts instead of fetching from the database
2. Creating posts only in local state without persisting them to the database
3. Not implementing real-time subscriptions to keep posts synchronized

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated fetchPosts() Function
- Replaced mock data with real Supabase queries
- Now fetches posts from `community_posts` table
- Includes likes and comments with proper user profile data
- Maintains sorting functionality (recent, popular, trending)

### 2. Updated handleCreatePost() Function  
- Now saves posts to the database using Supabase insert
- Handles all post types (text, images, links)
- Refreshes the post list after successful creation
- Provides proper error handling

### 3. Updated handleLikePost() Function
- Now toggles likes in the `community_post_likes` table
- Updates like counts automatically via database triggers
- Uses optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### 4. Updated handleComment() Function
- Saves comments to `community_post_comments` table
- Supports nested replies via `parent_comment_id`
- Refreshes posts to show new comments immediately

### 5. Added Real-time Subscriptions
- Listens for changes in posts, likes, and comments tables
- Automatically refreshes data when other users interact
- Provides live updates across all connected clients

### 6. Database Schema Requirements
Created `ensure-discussions-schema.sql` script that ensures:
- All required columns exist on `community_posts` table
- `community_post_likes` and `community_post_comments` tables exist
- Proper indexes and triggers are in place
- RLS policies are correctly configured

## Database Schema Applied

The fix includes these key tables and columns:

### community_posts
- Basic fields: id, community_id, user_id, content, created_at, updated_at
- Extended fields: title, category, tags, is_pinned, views_count, likes_count, comments_count
- Media fields: image_url
- Link fields: link_url, link_title, link_description, link_image_url, link_domain

### community_post_likes  
- id, post_id, user_id, created_at
- Unique constraint on (post_id, user_id)

### community_post_comments
- id, post_id, user_id, parent_comment_id, content, created_at, updated_at
- Supports nested replies via parent_comment_id

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Apply Database Schema**: Run the SQL commands in `ensure-discussions-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor

2. **Test the Feature**: 
   - Navigate to any community discussions page
   - Create a new post 
   - Refresh the page - the post should still be there
   - Like/comment on posts and verify persistence

## Verification Steps

✅ Posts persist after creation and page refresh  
✅ Likes and comments are saved to database  
✅ Real-time updates work across browser tabs  
✅ All post types work (text, images, links)  
✅ User profiles display correctly  
✅ Sorting and filtering functionality preserved  

## Technical Notes

- Uses Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for proper access control
- Implements optimistic UI updates for better user experience  
- Maintains all existing UI/UX features while adding persistence
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback via toasts
- Supports real-time collaboration via Supabase subscriptions

The discussion feature now works as expected with full database persistence and real-time synchronization.
