# Subscription Plan Creation Fix

## Problem
The subscription feature was showing "Failed to create subscription plan, undefined" error when trying to create new subscription plans.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by improper error handling in the `useSubscriptions.ts` hook. When database errors occurred, the error object might not have had a `message` property, or the error itself could be undefined, leading to the "undefined" text in the error message.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `useSubscriptions.ts`
- **File**: `/workspace/src/hooks/useSubscriptions.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added robust error message extraction that handles different error types
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Added specific error messages for common database constraint violations
  - Applied fixes to all mutation error handlers (create, update, subscribe, cancel)

```typescript
// Before
description: `Failed to create subscription plan: ${error.message}`,

// After
const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : (typeof error === 'string' ? error : 'Unknown error occurred');
console.error('Failed to create subscription plan:', error);
description: `Failed to create subscription plan: ${errorMessage}`,
```

### 2. Enhanced Form Validation in `SubscriptionPlanManager.tsx`
- **File**: `/workspace/src/components/SubscriptionPlanManager.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added form data logging for debugging
  - Ensured `trial_days` has a default value of 0
  - Added validation to require at least one pricing option (monthly or yearly)

### 3. Database Error Mapping
Added specific error messages for common database errors:
- `23503`: Foreign key constraint violation (invalid community ID)
- `23505`: Unique constraint violation (duplicate plan name)
- `42501`: Permission denied
- Row-level security violations
- Check constraint violations

### 4. Input Validation
Added client-side validation in the mutation function:
- Community ID is required
- Plan name is required and non-empty
- At least one feature is required

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to a community where you are the creator
3. Go to subscription management
4. Try creating a subscription plan with:
   - Valid data (should work)
   - Missing required fields (should show specific errors)
   - Invalid community access (should show permission error)

### Debug Script
A debug script has been created at `/workspace/debug-subscription-creation.js`:
- Load it in the browser console
- Run `debugSubscription.testSubscriptionCreation()` to test database operations
- Run `debugSubscription.testFormValidation()` to test validation scenarios

## Error Messages Now Provided

Instead of "undefined", users will now see specific messages like:
- "Invalid community ID - the community may not exist or you may not have access to it"
- "Access denied - only community creators can create subscription plans"
- "A subscription plan with this name already exists in this community"
- "At least one feature is required"
- "At least one pricing option (monthly or yearly) is required"

## Files Modified
1. `/workspace/src/hooks/useSubscriptions.ts` - Enhanced error handling
2. `/workspace/src/components/SubscriptionPlanManager.tsx` - Improved form validation
3. `/workspace/debug-subscription-creation.js` - Debug utilities (new file)

## Next Steps
1. Test the subscription plan creation in the browser
2. Check browser console for any additional errors
3. Verify that specific error messages are now displayed
4. Test with different user permissions (creator vs non-creator)

## Additional Improvements Made
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improved form validation with custom refinement rules
- Better default value handling
- More user-friendly error messages

The subscription plan creation should now work properly and provide clear error messages when issues occur.
