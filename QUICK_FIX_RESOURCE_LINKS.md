## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click"
**→ Check your browser's pop-up blocker**
- Look for blocked pop-up icon in address bar
- Click it and allow pop-ups

### "I don't see a URL on my resource"
**→ Make sure you entered a URL when creating it**
- Edit the resource or create a new one
- Fill in the "URL" field

### "Resource shows but still doesn't open"
**→ Try hard refreshing the page**
- Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

### "I created a resource before the fix"
**→ Create a new test resource**
- Old resources might have data issues
- New resources will definitely work

## URL Examples That Work

All these work now:
- ✅ `google.com`
- ✅ `www.github.com`
- ✅ `https://youtube.com`
