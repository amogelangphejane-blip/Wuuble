## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### WebRTC Configuration
```typescript
const defaultWebRTCConfig = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302' }
  ],
  mediaConstraints: {
    video: {
      width: { ideal: 1280, max: 1920 },
      height: { ideal: 720, max: 1080 },
      frameRate: { ideal: 30, max: 60 }
    },
    audio: {
      echoCancellation: true,
      noiseSuppression: true,
      autoGainControl: true,
      sampleRate: 48000
    }
  }
}
```

### Matching Algorithm
The matching system uses a weighted scoring approach:
1. **Compatibility Check**: Filters out incompatible users
2. **Score Calculation**: Assigns points based on various criteria
3. **Randomized Selection**: Picks from top-scoring candidates to avoid predictability
4. **History Tracking**: Prevents immediate re-matches

### Safety Implementation
- **Report Categories**: Structured reporting with predefined reasons
- **Auto-moderation**: Automatic actions based on report thresholds
- **User Blocking**: Persistent block lists with reason tracking
- **Content Filtering**: Real-time profanity detection and replacement
