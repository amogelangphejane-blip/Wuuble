## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// New state variables
const [isOwner, setIsOwner] = useState(false);
const [showSettings, setShowSettings] = useState(false);
```

### Owner Detection Logic
```typescript
// Handle both creator_id and owner_id fields
const communityData = {
  ...data,
  owner_id: data.owner_id || data.creator_id,
  activity_score: data.activity_score || 0
};

const ownerId = data.owner_id || data.creator_id;
setIsOwner(ownerId === user.id);
```

### Dialog Integration
```typescript
<CommunitySettings
  community={{...}}
  isOpen={showSettings}
  onClose={() => setShowSettings(false)}
  onUpdate={() => {
    fetchCommunity();
    toast({title: "Success", description: "Community updated"});
  }}
  onDelete={() => {
    toast({title: "Community Deleted"});
    navigate('/communities');
  }}
  isCreator={isOwner}
  userId={user?.id || ''}
/>
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Communities Table (Existing)
```sql
communities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,           -- ✅ Used for profile picture
  creator_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- ✅ Used for owner detection
  is_private BOOLEAN,        -- ✅ Used in settings
  member_count INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP       -- ✅ Auto-updated on changes
)
```

### Row Level Security
