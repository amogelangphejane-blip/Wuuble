## Part 1: Reply Feature Enhancements

### Features Added

#### 1. **Nested Reply System** üéØ
- Full support for replying to comments (not just posts)
- Parent-child relationship tracking with `parent_comment_id`
- Visual nesting with indentation and left border
- Unlimited reply depth support

#### 2. **Reply UI Improvements** üí¨
- **Reply Indicator Banner**: Blue highlight showing who you're replying to
- **Cancel Reply Button**: Easy escape from reply mode
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Enter` to submit
  - `Escape` to cancel
- **Auto-expand Comments**: Clicking reply opens the comments section automatically

#### 3. **Collapsible Reply Threads** üì¶
- Show/Hide button for each comment with replies
- Reply count badge (e.g., "Show 3 replies")
- Maintains collapsed state as users navigate
- Filled icon when expanded, outline when collapsed

#### 4. **Visual Enhancements** üé®
- Compact nested reply layout with smaller (6x6) avatars
- Clear visual hierarchy: 8x8 avatars for comments, 6x6 for replies
- Better spacing and borders for readability
- Full dark mode support with proper color schemes

### Technical Implementation

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [replyingTo, setReplyingTo] = useState<{
  postId: string;
  commentId: string;
  userName: string;
} | null>(null);

const [collapsedReplies, setCollapsedReplies] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

**Enhanced Comment Interface:**
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  post_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  user: User;
  parent_comment_id?: string | null;  // NEW
  replies?: Comment[];                 // NEW
}
```

**New Handler Functions:**
- `handleReplyClick()` - Initiates reply mode
- `handleCancelReply()` - Exits reply mode
- `toggleReplies()` - Show/hide reply threads
- `handleComment()` - Updated to support parent comments

## Part 2: Keyboard Disappearing Bug Fix

### The Problem üêõ
When typing in reply inputs, the keyboard would disappear after every single letter on mobile devices, and inputs would lose focus on desktop.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Inline Function Creation**: New function references created on every render
2. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Component re-rendering while input was focused
3. **Unstable Callbacks**: `onChange` and `onSubmit` recreated each render

### The Solution ‚úÖ

#### 1. Enhanced Component Memoization
Added custom comparison function to `CommentInput`:
```typescript
const CommentInput = React.memo(({ ... }) => {
  // Component code
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom deep comparison
  return (
    prevProps.postId === nextProps.postId &&
    prevProps.value === nextProps.value &&
    // ... checks all props including function references
  );
});
```

#### 2. Created CommentInputWrapper Component
Provides stable callback references using `useCallback`:
```typescript
const CommentInputWrapper = React.memo(({ ... }) => {
  const handleChange = useCallback((value: string) => {
    onCommentInputChange(inputKey, value);
  }, [inputKey, onCommentInputChange]);

  const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
    // Submit logic with stable reference
  }, [isReplyingToThisPost, replyingTo, post.id, onComment]);

  return <CommentInput ... />;
});
```

#### 3. Fixed handleCommentInputChange
Changed from `postId` parameter to `key` parameter to handle both simple and compound keys.

### Why It Works
```
Before: Type ‚Üí Re-render ‚Üí New functions ‚Üí Props change ‚Üí Re-render ‚Üí Lose focus ‚ùå
After:  Type ‚Üí Re-render ‚Üí Same functions ‚Üí Props unchanged ‚Üí No re-render ‚Üí Keep focus ‚úÖ
```

## Database Schema

Works with existing schema - no migration needed:

```sql
CREATE TABLE community_post_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES community_posts(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id UUID REFERENCES community_post_comments(id), -- Already exists
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
