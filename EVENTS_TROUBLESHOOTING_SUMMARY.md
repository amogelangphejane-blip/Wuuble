# Events Feature Troubleshooting Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **PRIMARY ISSUE: Missing Database Tables**
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL - BLOCKING ALL FUNCTIONALITY**

**Problem:** The database migrations for the events feature have not been applied to your Supabase instance. The following tables are missing:
- `community_events` - Main events table
- `event_categories` - Event categorization system
- `event_rsvps` - RSVP management
- `event_notifications` - Notification system  
- `user_event_preferences` - User preferences
- `event_shares` - Social sharing tracking

**Impact:** All events functionality fails because the application tries to query non-existent tables.

**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Created `apply_events_migrations.sql` with comprehensive migration script.

### 2. **SECONDARY ISSUE: Query Foreign Key Reference**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem:** The `useEvents` hook was using a hardcoded foreign key constraint name (`community_events_user_id_fkey`) in the Supabase query, which could fail if the constraint has a different name.

**Impact:** Even after migration, events might not load creator profile information properly.

**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Updated the query to use the standard column reference (`profiles!user_id`) instead of the constraint name.

## 🚀 How to Fix the Events Feature

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (REQUIRED)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `tgmflbglhmnrliredlbn`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `apply_events_migrations.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute

### Step 2: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Events Feature
1. Navigate to any community calendar: `/communities/:id/calendar`
2. Try creating a new event using the "Add Event" button
3. Test RSVP functionality
4. Verify event categories and filtering work

## 📋 What Will Work After Migration

Once the migration is applied, all these features will be functional:

### ✅ Event Management
- Create, edit, and delete events
- Event categories with color coding
- Recurring events support
- Event visibility settings (public, members-only, private)

- Multiple view modes (Calendar, List, Grid)
- Location suggestions and mapping
- User preferences management
- Tag-based organization

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### Fixed Query Issue
**File:** `src/hooks/useEvents.tsx`
**Change:** Updated foreign key reference in the events query
```diff
- creator_profile:profiles!community_events_user_id_fkey(display_name, avatar_url),
+ creator_profile:profiles!user_id(display_name, avatar_url),
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Apply the database migration using the SQL script
2. **VERIFY:** Test event creation and RSVP functionality
3. **OPTIONAL:** Update TypeScript types from Supabase dashboard
4. **OPTIONAL:** Test all advanced features (notifications, sharing, etc.)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues after applying the migration:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check the Supabase logs for database errors
3. Verify all tables were created successfully in the Supabase dashboard
4. Ensure your user account has proper permissions in the community

The events feature is a comprehensive system with many advanced features. Once the database migration is applied, it should work seamlessly with all the documented functionality.
