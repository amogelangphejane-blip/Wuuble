# Livestream Images Feature - Troubleshooting Report

## 🔍 Issues Identified

After a comprehensive analysis of your livestream image feature, I found several critical issues that are preventing the feature from working properly:

### 1. **Missing Storage Buckets** ❌
- **Issue**: All required storage buckets are missing from your Supabase project
- **Impact**: Image uploads will fail completely
- **Buckets Missing**:
  - `stream-images` (primary bucket for display images)
  - `stream-thumbnails` 
  - `stream-segments`
  - `stream-recordings`
  - `stream-chat-attachments`
  - `profile-pictures`
  - `community-avatars`

### 2. **Component Service Mismatch** ❌ ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: `StreamImageUpload.tsx` was using `thumbnailService` instead of `streamImageService`
- **Impact**: Wrong service calls, incorrect upload logic
- **Status**: ✅ **Fixed** - Updated component to use correct service

### 3. **Storage Policies Not Applied** ❌
- **Issue**: Even if buckets existed, the Row Level Security policies haven't been applied
- **Impact**: Permission denied errors for authenticated users trying to upload

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database Schema | ✅ **Working** | `live_streams`, `stream_images`, `profiles` tables exist |
| Storage Buckets | ❌ **Missing** | All 7 required buckets missing |
| Storage Policies | ❌ **Not Applied** | RLS policies need to be created |
| Component Logic | ✅ **Fixed** | Updated to use correct service |
| Migration Files | ✅ **Available** | All necessary SQL files exist |

## 🚀 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Create Storage Buckets and Apply Policies

You need to run the comprehensive SQL script I created. This can be done in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the script: `complete-livestream-storage-setup.sql`

**Alternative**: If you have service role access, you can run:
```bash
# You'll need your service role key for this
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key node setup-livestream-buckets.js
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:
```bash
node test-storage-setup.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ All 7 buckets exist
- ✅ All cleanup functions work
- ✅ Storage monitoring table accessible

### Step 3: Test with Authentication

The feature requires authenticated users. Make sure:
1. Users can sign up/login to your app
2. Test image upload with a logged-in user
3. Check that images appear in the discover page

## 🔧 Files Updated

### Fixed Files:
- ✅ `src/components/StreamImageUpload.tsx` - Now uses correct `streamImageService`

### New Files Created:
- 📄 `complete-livestream-storage-setup.sql` - Comprehensive setup script
- 📄 `setup-livestream-buckets.js` - JavaScript setup alternative
- 📄 `check-database-schema.js` - Schema verification tool

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

Once you run the setup script, the feature should work as follows:

1. **Stream Creation**: 
   - Users can upload display images when creating streams
   - Images are processed and stored in `stream-images` bucket
   - `display_image_url` is set on the `live_streams` record

2. **Stream Discovery**:
   - Custom display images appear on stream cards
   - Falls back to gradient placeholder if no image set
   - Images are served from public CDN URLs

3. **Stream Management**:
   - Creators can change display images after creation
   - Old images are properly cleaned up
   - Only stream creators can manage their images

## 🚨 Common Error Messages

### Before Fix:
```
Failed to upload: new row violates row-level security policy
```
```
Upload failed: The object exceeded the maximum allowed size
```
```
Database error: relation "stream_images" does not exist
```

### After Fix:
These errors should be resolved, and you'll see successful uploads with proper image URLs.

## 🔍 Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in your browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('stream_debug', 'true');
```

This will show detailed logs for:
- Image upload progress
- Storage bucket operations
- Database record creation
- Error details

## 📞 Testing Checklist

After applying the fixes, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Create a new stream with a display image
- [ ] View the stream in discovery page (should show custom image)
- [ ] Edit an existing stream to add/change display image
- [ ] Delete a stream (images should be cleaned up automatically)
- [ ] Try uploading various image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
- [ ] Test file size limits (should reject files > 5MB)
- [ ] Test with different user accounts (permissions)

## 🎉 Summary

The main issue was that **all storage buckets were missing** from your Supabase project. The database schema and component logic were mostly correct, but without the storage infrastructure, uploads would always fail.

**Priority**: Run the `complete-livestream-storage-setup.sql` script first - this will resolve 90% of the issues.

The component fix I made ensures that the right service is being called, but the storage setup is the critical blocker that needs to be resolved immediately.
