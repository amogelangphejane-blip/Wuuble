## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trying to join from Classroom
❌ Can't join from the Classroom page
✅ Must go back to main community page

### Mistake 2: Looking for "Add Resource" first
❌ "Add Resource" won't work until you join
✅ Join first, THEN add resources

### Mistake 3: Assuming you're already a member
❌ Just because you can see the classroom doesn't mean you're a member
✅ Check for "Join Community" button to be sure

## 🧪 Test: Are You a Member?

Run this quick test in console (F12):

```javascript
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const communityId = window.location.pathname.split('/')[2];

const { data } = await supabase
  .from('community_members')
  .select('role')
  .eq('user_id', session.user.id)
  .eq('community_id', communityId)
  .single();

if (data) {
  console.log('✅ YOU ARE A MEMBER! Role:', data.role);
} else {
  console.log('❌ YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER!');
  console.log('Go back and click "Join Community"');
}
```
